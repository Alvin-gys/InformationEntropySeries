# Information Entropy Series
This repository will include the code and experimental setup details for the paper "Exploring the impact of information entropy change in learning systems" across various supervised learning applications, including classification, domain adaptation, domain generalization, few-shot learning, segmentation, detection, etc.

[08/21/2023] Required by a reviewer, I tested on ImageNetV2 and achieved a top 1 accuracy of 84.8% (with LinearQ). I am not a lucky guy that the reviewer required my source code, the pre-trained weights, and settings, but gave a reject after got all my stuff. 

[04/12/2023] Achieved a top 1 accuracy of 95.38% on ImageNet-1K with pre-trained weights on ImageNet-21K.

Excited to extend the proposed theory for unsupervised learning, generative AI, and more. Work is currently in progress.

Research, coding, analysis, and maintenance are all on my own, so quite busy usually. Updates will be made periodically.
