# InformationEntropySeries
This repository will include the code and experimental setup details for the paper "Exploring the impact of information entropy change in learning systems" across various supervised learning applications, including classification, domain adaptation, domain generalization, few-shot learning, segmentation, detection, etc.

[04/12/2023] Achieved top 1 accuracy of 95.38% on ImageNet-1k with ImageNet-21K as pre-training data.
[08/21/2023] Required by the reviewer, tested on ImageNetV2, top 1 accuracy of 84.8% (LinearQ). I will test with OptimalQ, a much higher top 1 accuracy is expected on ImageNetV2.

I am excited to develop the proposed theory for unsupervised learning, generative AI, and more. Work is currently in progress.

Research, coding, analysis, and maintenance are all on my own, so quite busy usually. Updates will be made periodically.
