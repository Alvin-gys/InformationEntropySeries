# InformationEntropySeries
This repository will include the code and experimental setup details for exploring information entropy change in learning systems across various supervised learning applications, including classification, domain adaptation, domain generalization, few-shot learning, segmentation, detection, etc.

I am excited to develop the proposed theory for unsupervised learning, generative AI, and more. Work is currently in progress.

Research, coding, analysis, and maintenance are all on my own, so quite busy usually. Updates will be made periodically.
